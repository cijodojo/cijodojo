How to install mutillidae II on linux

By deafult the username and password giving by mutillidae is root and mutillidae, which do not work in linux. so we have to create a new user that can login to mutillidae.
  SELECT user FROM user;
  
step 1: - create a mutillidae database since it is required to access the service and also it is mentioned in the include/database_config.inc file in mutillidae.
if you are a kali user, do not worry the defalut MaraiDB server does our work. open the terminal and get inside the mysql server
  sudo mysql -u root
  mariaDB[None]> use mysql;

  mariaDB[mysql]> create database mutillidae;
  mysql> create user 'username'@localhost identified by 'p@ssw0rd';
  mysql> grant all on dvwa.* to dvwa@localhost;
  mysql> flush privileges;


// list all users
  mysql> SELECT user FROM user;
